For assignment 2 part 1, we decided to work with character data from Star Wars Episode 4. We began by loading in the packages we needed. Then we linked to our github repo, and loaded in all of the episode 4 interactions for all the characters. In this, we have two sections: edges and nodes. We took the nodes and put them into a nodes data frame. We then removed duplicate character ID's. Then we did the same thing with the edges, loading them into an edges data frame. We created our connection to neo4j, looped through all the nodes in the data frame and executed the cipher statement to load the nodes into the database. Then we did the same thing with the edges, loaded those into the database. You can see our graphs in blue, one contains nodes and one contains edges. We joined our edges and nodes datasets so that the Networkx node is the name of the character instead of the ID. We took the diameter, stored that in a variable, and then took the individuals who have no edges and loaded them as blank nodes. We grabbed all the weights of the edges, and created the color map at the bottom. The darker the line, the more interactions between two characters. The lighter the line, the fewer interactions between two characters. The circles which do not connect to any others are individuals without interactions in episode 4. The team was surprised that Owen was as prominent as he was and even did some manual digging into the data to make sure it was correct. It was! The data never ceases to surprise you.
