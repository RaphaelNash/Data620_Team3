2016-10-09 17:22:46;ezraklein;8. The defections from Trump, and the ex-neutrals weighing in against him (like Condi Rice), are the real story, and the real crisis
2016-10-09 17:21:48;ezraklein;7. It’s that dynamic, not the tape itself, that’s so dangerous for Trump

2016-10-09 17:20:42;ezraklein;5. Trump’s tape is giving Republicans who already wanted to abandon Trump an excuse to do so
2016-10-09 17:20:12;ezraklein;4. So nothing changed in Romney’s support from other Republicans around 47%, which is why there was little effect on his poll numbers
2016-10-09 17:19:50;ezraklein;3. But the key about 47% is it didn't interrupt the basic partisan dynamics of the election. GOP liked Romney, no one was looking to flee
