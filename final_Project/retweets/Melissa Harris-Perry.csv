2016-10-05 01:39:27;MHarrisPerry;But ... we should not reduce all policing issues to implicit bias. That is reductive and unsupported by evidence.
2016-10-05 01:37:48;MHarrisPerry;Implicit attitudes tests  reveal that African Americans tend to experience implicit racial bias as well, simply to a lesser extent.
2016-10-05 01:35:24;MHarrisPerry;It is important to understand implicit bias is *not* about accusations. That is what makes it implicit.

2016-09-15 16:28:17;MHarrisPerry;"Our national response to black women who are guilty of being victims of poverty, structural inequality, abuse, &amp; trauma is to lock them away"
2016-09-15 16:27:23;MHarrisPerry;Sharanda Jones, who told us “a life sentence in the federal system is just a very slow death.” President Obama granted her clemency in 2016.
2016-09-15 16:25:43;MHarrisPerry;Remember Sharanda Jones. 23. 8 y/o daughter. One count of conspiracy to  distribute crack cocaine. Life without the possibility of parole.
2016-09-15 16:24:32;MHarrisPerry;Remember Kemba Smith. 7 months pregnant. No criminal record. Charged with non-violent offense. Sentenced to 24 yrs under mandatory minimums.
2016-09-15 16:23:21;MHarrisPerry;Most women in federal prison are serving time for nonviolent drug offenses, often conspiracy charges.
2016-09-15 16:22:51;MHarrisPerry;The overwhelming majority of incarcerated women are survivors of domestic abuse, sexual violence, and childhood trauma.
2016-09-15 16:21:37;MHarrisPerry;The incarceration rate is almost twice as high for black versus white women. More than 60% of women in state prisons have a child under 18.
2016-09-15 16:21:04;MHarrisPerry;The jailing of black women has a devastating effect on black children and communities.
2016-09-15 16:20:17;MHarrisPerry;According to data from @SentencingProj, between 1980 and 2014 the number of incarcerated women increased by more than 700%.
2016-09-15 16:19:36;MHarrisPerry;Even though the total number of men behind bars is larger than the total number of women, the rate of growth for women has been faster.
2016-09-15 16:18:46;MHarrisPerry;"If we believe culture &amp; choices are to blame for bad outcomes, solutions coalesce around individual punishments rather than systemic change."
2016-09-15 16:16:58;MHarrisPerry;While we drag pregnant black women off to jail, no one is held accountable for poverty. Or charged for poisoning the children of Flint.
2016-09-15 16:15:51;MHarrisPerry;Poverty is the one factor which has been shown consistently to have lasting effects on the health and life outcomes of mothers and children.
2016-09-15 16:15:06;MHarrisPerry;A 2015 report ranked U.S. last among developed nations for maternal health outcomes, largely because of racial disparities for black women
2016-09-15 16:14:07;MHarrisPerry;In many states you can be arrested for illicit drugs in your system during birth. 70% of women charged with fetal abuse are women of color.
2016-09-15 16:12:54;MHarrisPerry;"25 years later there is no evidence to support the myth &amp; media creation of “crack babies.” It is a racial myth with very real consequences"
2016-09-15 16:12:07;MHarrisPerry;"It helped American public believe &amp; blame black mothers as the cause of social and economic decline through the epidemic of “crack babies”"
2016-09-15 16:10:21;MHarrisPerry;This made it easier for Ronald Reagan to turn black women into Cadillac driving welfare queens in the 1980s.
2016-09-15 16:08:23;MHarrisPerry;Moynihan report gave generations of policymakers permission to imagine poor black women as unrelenting cheats unfairly demanding assistance
2016-09-15 16:06:53;MHarrisPerry;In 1965 Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan concluded black women were the main problem in our own communities.
