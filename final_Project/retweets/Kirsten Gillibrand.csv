2017-01-31 20:10:40;SenGillibrand;A reminder that the deadline is today. #GetCovered: https://t.co/rJyLTZEisH https://t.co/tzZ9113c43
2017-01-31 18:33:29;SenGillibrand;Our willingness to accept those fleeing the most dangerous and violent places on earth is what the Statue of Liberty represents.
2017-01-31 00:58:05;SenGillibrand;"We have to fight.
We have to stand strong.
We have to say no. 

And we must not give up. We must not give in. https://t.co/aUzFOjQJ8u"
2017-01-30 23:15:12;SenGillibrand;Our Secretary of State must be willing to stand up for our values. Not convinced that Rex Tillerson would use this position to do that.
2017-01-30 23:14:20;SenGillibrand;I'm concerned about his enormous conflicts of interest and disturbed by his evasion on basic questions about human rights.
2017-01-30 23:13:51;SenGillibrand;I'm voting no on Rex Tillerson's nomination as Secretary of State and will urge my Senate colleagues to join me.
2017-01-30 21:30:10;SenGillibrand;Proud to join thousands of NYers in Battery Park yesterday to speak out against @POTUS's refugee executive order. https://t.co/MBl5gKvSPl
2017-01-30 20:06:29;SenGillibrand;Outrageous that kids in Upstate NY without Internet service at home have to do their homework in the library parking lot or at McDonald's.
2017-01-30 20:02:53;SenGillibrand;I fought to keep $170m in federal funding to expand rural broadband access in NY, pleased @FCC has approved it. https://t.co/CErWdQdFnW

2017-01-29 20:24:52;SenGillibrand;Keep marching. Keep protesting. Keep raising your voice as loudly and forcefully as you can against this hateful and discriminatory policy.
2017-01-29 20:23:27;SenGillibrand;For those at rallies and protests in New York and across the country: After today, do not quiet down. Do not stop this fight.
2017-01-29 20:20:47;SenGillibrand;It's an absolute moral and ethical failure, and goes against everything the Statue of Liberty represents and our New York values.
2017-01-29 20:18:51;SenGillibrand;.@POTUS's Executive Order on immigrants and refugees is a mark of shame on our country. And it makes us less safe.
2017-01-29 20:17:12;SenGillibrand;An honor to raise my voice with thousands of New Yorkers in Battery Park today. https://t.co/oUpkKN2bKf
2017-01-29 18:37:44;SenGillibrand;Today at 2pm in Battery Park, I'll stand with thousands of concerned New Yorkers to protest Trump's shameful executive order.

2017-01-28 01:04:12;SenGillibrand;"Our diversity is what makes us strong. I'll continue to stand with immigrant &amp; refugee families and I'll fight in the Senate to protect them"
2017-01-28 01:02:31;SenGillibrand;"Taking in refugees helps make our country safer by showing the world that America cares for children &amp; families facing strife &amp; persecution."
2017-01-28 00:59:14;SenGillibrand;"Our willingness to accept those who are fleeing the most dangerous &amp; violent places on earth is what the Statue of Liberty represents."
2017-01-28 00:57:09;SenGillibrand;"Pres. Trump’s executive orders on immigration &amp; refugees fly in the face of our #NY values and the foundation on which our nation was built."
2017-01-27 23:46:05;SenGillibrand;Today we mark #HolocaustMemorialDay, a day to remember the millions we lost and to rededicate ourselves to ensuring it never happens again.

2017-01-27 20:45:14;SenGillibrand;We must expand #ruralbroadband service in Upstate #NY, where some kids have to sit in a library parking lot just to do their homework.
2017-01-27 20:40:58;SenGillibrand;I was proud to push for this @FCC funding and will continue fighting to get my bipartisan #ruralbroadband bill passed in the Senate.
2017-01-27 20:31:05;SenGillibrand;Pleased @FCC has approved up to $170 million in federal funding to expand #ruralbroadband access in Upstate #NY. https://t.co/bM35wDh8Hi

2017-01-24 21:25:08;SenGillibrand;If our public education fails, then America fails, and I do not believe Mrs. DeVos shares my commitment to a strong public education system.
2017-01-24 21:20:42;SenGillibrand;Students, parents and teachers deserve an Education Secretary whose commitment to public education and safe schools will never waver.
2017-01-24 21:18:58;SenGillibrand;"I share your deep concerns about Betsy DeVos's nomination &amp; will be voting against her confirmation. I'll urge my colleagues to do the same."
