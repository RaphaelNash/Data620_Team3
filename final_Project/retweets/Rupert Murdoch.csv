2016-03-04 15:31:14;rupertmurdoch;No more tweets for ten days or ever!   Feel like the luckiest AND happiest man in world.
2016-03-04 11:05:24;rupertmurdoch;Consider comparative  primary turnouts for Republicans and Democrats.  @natesilver not such good prediction record these days.
2016-03-04 09:30:59;rupertmurdoch;If Trump nominated some Republicans may stay home, but not nearly as many Dems already abstaining or crossing over!
2016-03-03 12:30:35;rupertmurdoch;UK Brexit campaign gathers force as government makes obviously false claims aimed at scaring voters. Early days yet.
2016-03-02 20:57:12;rupertmurdoch;"As predicted, Trump reaching out to make peace with Republican ""establishment"".  If he becomes inevitable party would be mad not to unify."
2016-02-28 19:45:11;rupertmurdoch;UK Labor so hopeless ruling Tories indulge in tearing each other apart over Europe..  Dangerous, even if started by Cameron.
2016-02-28 19:41:53;rupertmurdoch;"Both ""establishment"" Republicans and Trump need to cool it and close ranks to fight real enemy.  Trump, Rubio, Kasich could all win general."
2016-02-28 19:39:09;rupertmurdoch;NYT fawning story about Hillary and Libya fails to mention resulting state of country today and rise of ISIS there.
2016-02-20 01:14:58;rupertmurdoch;Congratulations Michael Gove.   Friends always knew his principles would overcome his personal friendships.
2016-02-20 01:06:49;rupertmurdoch;Pope was wrong, but Trump moved fast to make peace!   Bet he changes tone but not policy if still winning most states by mid-March.
2016-02-20 01:01:31;rupertmurdoch;Tomorrow's polls. If Trump beats Cruz by ten plus or Rubio runs 2nd it's over for Cruz. And if Sanders beats Hilary in Nev curtains for her.
2016-02-18 20:19:56;rupertmurdoch;Trump blames me for WSJ poll, fights FoxNews. Time to calm down.  If I running anti-Trump conspiracy then doing lousy job!
2016-02-13 23:33:27;rupertmurdoch;Great reads in WSJ:  Charles Murray on Trumps' America and Juan Williams on pandering in the Carolinas..  Great reminders of our problems.
2016-02-13 20:56:45;rupertmurdoch;Tonight's  audience in S.C.  Probably rigged by party establishment.   Repeating old tricks from previous elections.
2016-02-12 23:22:12;rupertmurdoch;Is Hillary scared of something?  Endlessly eulogises Obama while whole world knows of their intense mutual antipathy.
2016-02-12 23:00:31;rupertmurdoch;Sadly UK's Independent print paper closes after about 30 years.  Any loss of diversity bad.
2016-02-12 22:49:44;rupertmurdoch;US race relations bad enough without Clinton, Sanders trolling for black votes trying to criminalise cops.  Worst type of pandering.
2016-02-12 18:37:05;rupertmurdoch;"New S.C. Poll has Trump 36-19 Cruz.  Great brawl coming, plus second one between mutual hating ""moderates""."
2016-02-12 16:58:15;rupertmurdoch;Soft left softball from Clinton donor Woodruff, last night's CNN-PBS non-debate.
2016-02-10 17:34:24;rupertmurdoch;Chris Christie, suicide bomber.  Damages victim while blowing himself up!
2016-02-10 02:25:31;rupertmurdoch;Hillary speech awful point after point.  Eg, better education but against charters, rein in Wall St which she will never do, etc.
2016-02-07 13:06:56;rupertmurdoch;All really failed to understand immensity of global Muslim problem.  No easy answers, but Middle East just a forerunner to sub-Sahara Africa
2016-02-07 13:02:20;rupertmurdoch;Christie the tough bullying prosecutor. Not much on big issues.  Kasich the safe moderate, everyone's Vice President.  Carson also best yet.
2016-02-07 12:58:32;rupertmurdoch;Cruz a great debater performed well, but why do all long-term acquaintances distrust him?  Jeb Bush best yet.  Easily visualise him in WH.
2016-02-07 12:52:35;rupertmurdoch;Trump better, somewhat contained and more presidential.    Rubio inspirational speaker, a winner.  But does he have real depth of knowledge?
2016-02-07 12:50:32;rupertmurdoch;All candidates lifted game last night.   Everyone seemed better than alternative Dems.
2016-02-07 12:49:23;rupertmurdoch;@rupertmurdoch
2016-02-07 00:24:10;rupertmurdoch;Cameron's EU non-deal shocks UK opinion.  Now he's rumoured to be begging cabinet colleagues to put aside beliefs.
2016-02-07 00:18:27;rupertmurdoch;Do Obamas really want Hillary to win?
2016-02-07 00:16:23;rupertmurdoch;Of course Hillary's agent sought top dollar fees.  Why lie?   What she told Wall St friends IS relevant and we will never be told.
2016-02-06 14:09:04;rupertmurdoch;Watch Hillary's candidacy sink and sink.  Nobody buying and more big trouble coming on emails.  Dems looking for replacement.  John Kerry?
2016-02-04 17:22:28;rupertmurdoch;"Hillary:""When I took those speaking fees I did not know I would be running for president!""   Oh yeah!!"
2016-02-04 14:02:08;rupertmurdoch;Cameron's deal with EU a nothing.   How can sensible Cabinet colleagues accept this?  Loyalty to country more important than friendships.
2016-02-02 19:10:53;rupertmurdoch;Huge night for Rubio.   Plenty of room for Trump to come back while Cruz will be a big factor in South.  Now a real three horse  race.
2016-02-01 11:12:26;rupertmurdoch;UK-EU negotiations meaningless without complete control of borders.  Must be able to choose immigrants.
2016-01-31 14:28:44;rupertmurdoch;Hillary email troubles get really serious.    WH has surprising alternates if things get worse.
2016-01-30 20:09:06;rupertmurdoch;Hillary email breaches get very serious, even though certain Russia, China, Israel had the server hacked full time for years.
2016-01-29 14:43:12;rupertmurdoch;No Trump allowed several to shine.   Especially Bush, Rubio, Rand Paul.   Polls will be interesting, but Donald's figures near unassailable.
2016-01-28 22:36:11;rupertmurdoch;Republican candidates must be looking forward to tonight's debate.   Speaking without Donald getting all attention.  Aim for independents.
2016-01-27 16:15:51;rupertmurdoch;"Google has cleverly planted dozens of their people in White House, Downing St, other governments.
Most brilliant new lobbying effort yet."
2016-01-27 16:13:05;rupertmurdoch;Tech tax breaks facilitated by politicians easily awed by Valley ambassadors like Google chairman Schmidt eg, posh boys in Downing St.@
2016-01-27 16:08:42;rupertmurdoch;Global tech companies making enormous profits most places, funnelling $$ thru tax havens. Unless stopped will ruin local businesses who pay.
2016-01-27 16:03:10;rupertmurdoch;Google et al broke no tax laws.  Now paying token amounts for p r purposes. Won't work. Need strong new laws to pay like the rest of us.
2016-01-27 16:00:12;rupertmurdoch;This is Bloomberg's last chance.   You never know until your hat is  in the ring!  Events change everything, especially during elections.
2016-01-23 19:37:01;rupertmurdoch;Allegedly Bloomberg again considering running.   If he does, may hurt Clinton more than Trump.  Seems 2016 the year for populists.
2016-01-20 16:44:50;rupertmurdoch;Obama says Australia second biggest anti-iSIS fighter.   So where the heck are NATO partners?
2016-01-16 00:47:22;rupertmurdoch;Cruz bets uniting white conservatives/evangelicals enough,   Meanwhile Trump appealing across party lines.  Surely the winning strategy.
2016-01-16 00:43:47;rupertmurdoch;24 hours and many influential Republicans see Trump inevitable and get ready to switch.  United by horror of Hillary whose campaign staggers
2016-01-15 03:14:05;rupertmurdoch;GOP debate.  All candidates do well, Rubio and Trump most effective.  Cruz brilliant debater, but what else?  Like ability still important!
2016-01-14 23:33:03;rupertmurdoch;Another big debate tonight.  Thanks Roger Ailes again for another great production. Keep 'em coming better and better than competitors.
2016-01-13 03:58:13;rupertmurdoch;"O speech proclaims great virtue of Iran nuclear deal.
Tomorrow's headlines: ""Iran grabs ten US sailors""!"
2016-01-13 03:33:39;rupertmurdoch;Where to start on Obama speech?   Sounded mostly great, but totally divorced from reality.  Both US and world.  Sad.
2016-01-09 03:20:46;rupertmurdoch;CES 2016.   Software takes over from hardware.  Really about software created platforms.
2016-01-02 22:03:26;rupertmurdoch;Musk worries about AI.  hope he leads the charge, regardless of Google friendships.  Time running out.
2016-01-02 21:15:33;rupertmurdoch;American innovation!  Nothing beats SpaceX.   Quickly becomes world leader in massive space business. All made in US.  Triumph for Elon Musk
