2016-09-19 15:57:00;jmurray20;@LorenRaeDeJ But representing your country in an international setting is a whole different thing...
2016-09-19 15:56:23;jmurray20;@LorenRaeDeJ Especially if it's actually raising awareness and helping to move the country forward.
2016-09-19 15:54:52;jmurray20;@LorenRaeDeJ IMHO, if she really feels strongly about making a statement in a domestic game, like all athletes, have at it.
2016-09-19 15:52:49;jmurray20;@LorenRaeDeJ then maybe you dont really understand what it is your protesting in the first place.
2016-09-19 15:52:08;jmurray20;@LorenRaeDeJ Which goes to your point - if youre willing to play for a country that you feel the need to protest in an international setting
2016-09-19 15:50:43;jmurray20;@LorenRaeDeJ ...you shouldnt be there in the first place.
2016-09-19 15:49:48;jmurray20;@LorenRaeDeJ If you can't stand up for our national anthem in a competition in which you are representing our country...
2016-09-19 15:48:44;jmurray20;@LorenRaeDeJ International athletic competition is a way to project soft power, just like exporting our culture and relying on diplomacy

2016-08-14 19:18:37;jmurray20;And that's how we honor Captain Khan and his parents.
2016-08-14 19:18:09;jmurray20;We must send a message so strong that people like Trump are returned back to the fringe, so we never hear from anyone like him again.
2016-08-14 19:15:53;jmurray20;It's not enough to get to 270 electoral votes. We must do far better.
2016-08-14 19:14:21;jmurray20;And think about how destructive and un-American Donald Trump's policies are.  And vote on November 8th.

2016-08-14 19:10:48;jmurray20;...you'll stop giving the likes of Carl Paladino the attention he craves. Instead, remind everyone what Mr. Khan said that night.
2016-08-14 19:10:11;jmurray20;To really get back at those who spread awful lies about a family that has sacrificed more than most of us can imagine...
2016-08-14 19:05:27;jmurray20;"""Have you ever even read the constitution?"" Mr. Khan asked."
2016-08-14 19:04:49;jmurray20;And he was reminded that, in Donald Trump's America, Captain Khan wouldn't have been allowed into the country that he died defending.
2016-08-14 19:03:06;jmurray20;He was told that Humayun Khan gave his life for this country and its citizens.
2016-08-14 19:02:22;jmurray20;Trump was reminded that he called for a ban on Muslims entering this country.
2016-08-14 19:01:29;jmurray20;"Donald Trump said he was ""viciously attacked"" by Mr. Khan, &amp; that he has a right to respond. But he wasnt attacked. He was asked a question."
2016-08-14 19:00:22;jmurray20;...which is the attention to be shifted away from what Mr. and Mrs. Khan said that evening, and to a character assassination.
2016-08-14 18:59:26;jmurray20;But any more than a quick condemnation is giving the people who spew this hate exactly what they want...
2016-08-14 18:58:42;jmurray20;These attacks should be condemned by every American, especially elected officials and anyone who aspires to be a leader in this country.
