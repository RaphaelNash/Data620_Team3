2016-04-27 22:02:04;madeleine;The so-called #TrumpDoctrine is simply bellicose rhetoric strung together with contradictory statements. Bluster is no strategy, Mr. Trump.
2016-04-27 22:00:14;madeleine;Trumpâ€™s proposals to ban Muslims and deport immigrants would undermine Americaâ€™s greatest strengths: diversity and tolerance.

2016-04-27 21:53:00;madeleine;Trumpâ€™s views on torture are completely out of sync with recommendations by military leaders and Americaâ€™s values.
2016-04-27 21:51:23;madeleine;Trump praises Western values, then questions why we should support democracy in other countries.
2016-04-27 21:50:24;madeleine;Trumpâ€™s understanding of trade policy is simplistic at best, and would have disastrous effects on our economy.
2016-04-27 21:49:44;madeleine;Trump preaches unpredictability as a policy, then asks us to trust him with the nuclear codes.
2016-04-27 21:48:47;madeleine;Trump speaks about regaining the trust of our allies, but then threatens to pull out of NATO.
2016-04-27 21:47:32;madeleine;Trump demonstrates no real understanding of complex international issues and has no serious proposals for how to address them.
