2017-01-04 19:14:16;bkesling;"15/15. Here's a primer about what's out there now and how the VA already has some privatization in place.

https://t.co/nw9A36RLgA

@WSJ"
2017-01-04 19:12:22;bkesling;14. Critics say it's not enough, and the VA is moving too slow.
2017-01-04 19:11:43;bkesling;13. And, the VA says, some of that change is now underway. Some needs Congressional action.
2017-01-04 19:10:25;bkesling;12. It is important to realize the VA provides substantial care in the private sector, but even the VA says that system needs updating.
2017-01-04 19:08:01;bkesling;11. If vets are given full choice, how many would still go to the VA and what would they want to use the VA for?
2017-01-04 19:07:26;bkesling;10. Vets who use the VA system tend to like their healthcare, which leaves a huge question to be answered...
2017-01-04 19:05:46;bkesling;@carriefarmer It doesn't look as if scoring of full choice has been done by anyone.  It could cause costs to skyrocket.
2017-01-04 19:04:21;bkesling;9. Which still concerns some lawmakers and veterans groups who say once the move towards privatization begins, it will continue apace.
2017-01-04 19:02:49;bkesling;8. Proposals that Trump has likely been briefed on probably don't advocate straight-up privatization of the VA...but a move towards it.
2017-01-04 19:00:43;bkesling;7. That sort of plan would make the VA, in essence an insurance provider, though would retain the VA system if veterans want to use it.
2017-01-04 18:53:46;bkesling;6. Critics say vets should be empowered to make their own healthcare choices, forcing VA to compete with the private sector.
2017-01-04 18:53:06;bkesling;5. The VA says they want to focus on outcomes for veterans and by managing care they can do so...
2017-01-04 18:51:11;bkesling;"4. Critics of the system find fault with the VA as the gatekeeper for care.  

Veterans can't just go out and get a private appointment."
2017-01-04 18:49:40;bkesling;"3. In 2016 the VA tallied some $11 billion in care from private providers

That's about 17% of the department's healthcare costs."
