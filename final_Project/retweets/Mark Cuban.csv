2017-04-01 21:14:37;mcuban;11) Trump had no idea this was happening. He was doing what he was told to do. Stick to the script and read what was written for him

2017-04-01 21:01:47;mcuban;6) As people with Russian connects came into the campaign he had no clue that those connections were possibly being influenced by Russia
2017-04-01 20:59:08;mcuban;5) When Manafort was recommended, he didn't vett him. He saw it as a win win. Win the election or open the door for more Russian business
2017-04-01 20:57:11;mcuban;4) He spoke favorably about Putin to get his approval for Russians to get $ out of Russia and into Trump deals.  He saw it as easy money
2017-04-01 20:48:44;mcuban;3) He ignored their backgrounds. But that's not unusual.  Starbucks takes anyone's money and so do most businesses including mine.

2016-08-23 23:07:06;mcuban;@AndySwan Id rather work on fed gov inefficiencies because of the macro impact and the check and balances and courts rather than 10k battles
2016-08-23 23:04:12;mcuban;.@AndySwan The risk doesn't leave the system when you push it local. It just costs more in aggregate.
2016-08-23 23:02:57;mcuban;@AndySwan the question is which in aggregate cost business and individuals the least, plus the cost of  unrest because of hopelessness
2016-08-23 23:00:11;mcuban;@AndySwan I think they are both inefficient. Local has few checks and balances. Fed does. Local is popularity more than fed.
2016-08-23 22:58:04;mcuban;@AndySwan look at the crushing impact of licensing and registration fees on startups. Push it all local and startups get crushed.
2016-08-23 22:56:59;mcuban;@AndySwan what about where there isn't the tax base ?  which is worse for local business, non stop local tax increases or fed taxes?
2016-08-23 22:53:58;mcuban;@AndySwan what is the efficiency/cost comparison for federal programs  vs comparable programs repeated locally around the country?
2016-08-23 22:51:56;mcuban;@AndySwan  what happens to  those who need assistance? How do local and state pay for the programs or lack there of ?
