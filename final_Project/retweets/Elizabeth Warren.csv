2017-01-31 17:58:56;SenWarren;"It’s time for the Senate to stand up for the Constitution &amp; exert moral leadership. I urge my colleagues: Vote NO on Jeff Sessions for AG."
2017-01-31 17:57:46;SenWarren;Jeff Sessions is so dangerous that a Republican-controlled Senate rejected his nomination to a federal judgeship 30 years ago.
2017-01-31 17:56:52;SenWarren;"Trump expects us to replace the AG w/ Jeff Sessions, whose career is defined by hostility to civil rights, immigrants &amp; the rule of law."
2017-01-31 17:54:04;SenWarren;Let me repeat: the @POTUS fired the nation’s top law enforcement officer for refusing to defend an illegal, unconstitutional, immoral order.
2017-01-31 17:53:16;SenWarren;"Last night, the acting AG refused to defend @realDonaldTrump’s unlawful &amp; unconstitutional Muslim ban, so Trump fired her."

2017-01-30 18:28:28;SenWarren;Steve Mnuchin won't give us an honest answer about his foreclosure record. He's not going to give us one when we give him our economy.
2017-01-30 18:27:00;SenWarren;If Steve Mnuchin were the Captain of the Titanic, he’d deny ever hitting the iceberg.
2017-01-30 18:26:03;SenWarren;"You have to wonder, @SenateDems &amp; @SenateGOP: What else is Steve Mnuchin willing to lie about if we hand him the keys to @USTreasury?"
2017-01-30 18:24:46;SenWarren;Mnuchin lied about his bank’s illegal tactics in response to @SenBobCasey's q's. There’s no other way to say it. https://t.co/lUsVQChRMd

2017-01-28 00:05:28;SenWarren;Turning our back on refugees because of their religion creates recruiting fodder for ISIS and other terrorist groups.
2017-01-28 00:04:12;SenWarren;"The Syrian refugees admitted to the US last yr are kids, doctors, teachers, engineers, &amp; college students who sought safety from terrorists."

2017-01-28 00:01:50;SenWarren;".@realDonaldTrump's order restricting immigrants from Muslim countries &amp; freezing admission of refugees is a betrayal of American values."

2017-01-27 18:58:03;SenWarren;Betsy DeVos repeatedly demonstrated contempt for public ed. She plans to maintain financial ties that could create conflicts of interest.
2017-01-27 18:56:37;SenWarren;I will vote against Betsy DeVos’s nomination for @USedgov because it’s not in the best interests of America’s young people.

2017-01-24 20:57:23;SenWarren;Budget Director nominee @RepMickMulvaney said today he believes the @CFPB is a “sad, sick joke” and that he finds the agency “offensive”
2017-01-23 23:00:43;SenWarren;I’m glad the @CFPB is cleaning up student loan servicing and holding @Navient accountable. That’s why we need a strong consumer agency.
2017-01-23 22:59:47;SenWarren;There’s a reason why @Navient usually scores dead last in every @usedgov borrower satisfaction survey.
2017-01-23 22:59:19;SenWarren;Every time I tweet or post about @Navient, students and families share stories about how they were harmed by this student loan giant.

2017-01-23 21:12:50;SenWarren;.@POTUS Trump is reinstating the “global gag rule” to stop funding for overseas health centers that may provide abortion. This is insanity.

2017-01-20 23:27:23;SenWarren;We must measure @POTUS @realDonaldTrump by actions, not only words. And today he made it harder for families to achieve the American Dream.
2017-01-20 23:26:15;SenWarren;That’s 40,000 families who just lost their chance to buy a home thanks to brand-new @POTUS @realDonaldTrump.
2017-01-20 23:25:30;SenWarren;.@POTUS suspended a planned cut in FHA mortgage insurance premiums, which @nardotrealtor says will cost 40k families a shot at a new home.

2016-11-18 19:52:12;SenWarren;If @realDonaldTrump refuses to reverse on @SenatorSessions, it falls on the Senate to exercise fundamental moral leadership for our nation.
2016-11-18 19:51:19;SenWarren;Instead of embracing the bigotry of his rallies, I urge @realDonaldTrump to reverse his decision to nominate @SenatorSessions for AG.

2016-11-17 22:46:41;SenWarren;Today I spoke about @realDonaldTrump’s decision to hand over the government to the worst special interests. Watch: https://t.co/mx9z44CZ13
2016-11-17 22:45:31;SenWarren;.@realDonaldTrump isn’t “draining the swamp.” He’s inviting the biggest, ugliest swamp monsters in the front door.
2016-11-17 19:36:53;SenWarren;About to speak on the Senate floor about @RealDonaldTrump’s broken promise to #draintheswamp. Watch live: https://t.co/9cyvsLgdnt
2016-11-17 19:22:25;SenWarren;"Registering &amp; tracking Americans based on race or religion is idiotic. Disgusting. Unconstitutional. And it’s a recruiting bonanza for ISIS."
2016-11-17 18:16:13;SenWarren;If @realDonaldTrump thinks we’re going to just roll over while his Wall St buddies crash our economy again, they're in for a rude awakening.
2016-11-17 18:14:39;SenWarren;"Why is Wall St celebrating @realDonaldTrump? Because his administration ""looks like an investment banker’s dream.” https://t.co/ugnYkjTOd7"

2016-11-16 23:31:37;SenWarren;.@realDonaldTrump appointed a bigot as his WH Chief Strategist. This is a moral test for all of us – including the business community.

2016-11-15 21:44:51;SenWarren;"Keeping these lobbyists &amp; insiders on your team sends a clear message, @realDonaldTrump: your campaign was a giant con."
2016-11-15 21:43:28;SenWarren;"You already broke your promise, @realDonaldTrump. You stacked your transition team with Wall Street elites, insiders &amp; lobbyists."
2016-11-15 21:42:12;SenWarren;".@realDonaldTrump, you promised the American people you’d #draintheswamp of lobbyists &amp; insiders rigging the system for the rich &amp; powerful."
2016-11-15 00:03:52;SenWarren;The President of the United States should condemn bigots, @realDonaldTrump. Not give them a West Wing office to decide our country's future.
2016-11-15 00:02:48;SenWarren;"Steve Bannon promoted white nationalism, @realDonaldTrump. He's been praised by KKK supporters &amp; denounced by @splcenter &amp; @ADL_National ."
2016-11-15 00:01:42;SenWarren;"Tell us, @realDonaldTrump: You said you'd be a ""President for all."" Then why are you embracing the ugliness &amp; divisiveness of your campaign?"
2016-11-14 18:10:33;SenWarren;Let me be clear: It's foolish for any Dem to think that weakening support for the @CFPB is good for the country or good for us as a party.
2016-11-14 18:09:05;SenWarren;"Anyone in Congress – GOP or Dem – who votes to weaken the @CFPB will declare loud &amp; clear they represent giant banks, not working families."
2016-11-14 18:07:39;SenWarren;"The @CFPB has returned over $11 BILLION to consumers who have been cheated by big banks &amp; financial institutions."
2016-11-14 18:06:28;SenWarren;"If I were Wall Street &amp; the GOP, I’d be scared too: The @CFPB goes after big banks like @WellsFargo when they break the law."
2016-11-14 18:05:16;SenWarren;"The real reason Wall St &amp; their @GOP allies are going after the @CFPB is because it’s working too darn well for consumers &amp; must be stopped."
2016-11-14 18:04:17;SenWarren;You’re going to hear a lot of reasons why we must make these changes to the @CFPB. Not one of them is going to be true.
2016-11-14 18:03:28;SenWarren;"It’s only been a few days since the election &amp; Wall St banks &amp; their @GOP friends are already licking their chops to undercut the @CFPB."
2016-10-21 18:28:23;SenWarren;And @FCC should ban unreasonable pay-for-privacy schemes that coerce consumers to give up #privacy for discounts. https://t.co/CG8MNN9LcJ

2016-10-18 21:27:02;SenWarren;Today the @SocialSecurity Admin announced a 0.3% COLA for 2017. For many Americans struggling to make ends meet, that offers little relief.
2016-10-14 17:16:14;SenWarren;The SEC needs new leadership to return to its mission to protect investors. @POTUS should use his authority to designate a new chair today
2016-10-14 17:14:42;SenWarren;SEC Chair White has refused to advance a rule to require public corporations to disclose political spending despite broad bipartisan support
2016-10-14 17:13:25;SenWarren;But under Chair White the SEC routinely ignores needs of investors to cater to interests of big businesses, dragging its feet on key rules
2016-10-14 17:12:05;SenWarren;The SEC has a simple purpose: to protect investors by ensuring they have the information they need to make decisions
2016-10-14 17:10:17;SenWarren;Today I asked @POTUS to immediately designate a new Chair of the SEC to replace Mary Jo White: https://t.co/Jin8kvpbZ5

2016-10-12 23:13:18;SenWarren;"A bank CEO should not be able to oversee a massive fraud &amp; simply walk away to enjoy his millions in retirement."
2016-10-12 23:12:10;SenWarren;"A bank teller would face criminal charges &amp; a prison sentence for stealing a handful of 20s from the cash drawer."
2016-10-12 23:10:59;SenWarren;If @WellsFargo’s John Stumpf is leaving with all of his ill-gotten millions, that's still not real accountability.
2016-10-12 23:08:54;SenWarren;"As I said: @WellsFargo CEO Stumpf should resign, return every nickel he made during the scam, &amp; face DOJ/SEC investigation. He’s 1 for 3."

2016-09-30 19:00:08;SenWarren;Watch @RepGutierrez tell this Board to open its doors to actual Puerto Ricans, not just Wall Street. https://t.co/VvYErL4IAX
2016-09-30 18:58:54;SenWarren;If this unelected Board wants Puerto Rico to believe it takes their crisis seriously, they can start by leaving NY. Start by showing up.
2016-09-30 18:57:33;SenWarren;I guess holding the mtg in Puerto Rico would've been inconvenient. 20,000+ Zika cases. Recent blackouts left 1M w/o power. 340k w/o water.
2016-09-30 18:56:29;SenWarren;Will this Board speak for the ppl of Puerto Rico or the bankers? Today it met for the first time - not in PR, but NYC. That's a bad start.
2016-09-30 18:55:30;SenWarren;"Congress passed a bill in June to ""help"" Puerto Rico - handing authority over PR to an unelected Board, but providing no actual resources."

2016-09-29 19:38:57;SenWarren;Today I wrote to @usedgov demanding their student loan bank halt collection of Corinthian students’ debt: https://t.co/qk6LpjPfeP
2016-09-29 19:37:59;SenWarren;"That means Corinthian’s victims eligible for loan forgiveness are instead having tax refunds, EITC &amp; Social Security garnished. It’s absurd."
2016-09-29 19:36:57;SenWarren;We uncovered data that instead of simply discharging the loans of Corinthian’s victims, @usedgov pushed 80k of them to debt collectors.
2016-09-29 19:35:59;SenWarren;Corinthian Colleges went belly up amid findings that it defrauded students. Under fed law, those students are eligible for loan discharge.
2016-09-29 16:37:19;SenWarren;"That’s the @GOP agenda in a nutshell: Pay Congress to do nothing, &amp; block back-breaking Americans from getting paid for a hard day’s work."
2016-09-29 16:36:21;SenWarren;Last night @HouseGOP voted to delay our new overtime rule by 6 months. Kill a simple rule that hard-working people deserve to get paid.

2016-09-28 14:09:18;SenWarren;.@WellsFargo employees who tried to sound the alarm about the creation of fake accounts were fired. Their lives turned upside down.

2016-02-04 20:56:20;SenWarren;If we want strong enforcement, personnel is policy. Read Commissioner Bowen’s call for tougher Wall St enforcement: https://t.co/sm3QxIsEFA
2016-02-04 19:22:42;SenWarren;Every single House Republican who came to work today just voted to make it harder to hold big banks accountable for fraud. Shameful.
2016-02-04 15:59:22;SenWarren;Tell Congress: They work for the American people — not Wall Street banks that break the law. Vote NO on HR 766.
2016-02-04 15:58:57;SenWarren;"You read that right: The House is just minutes away from voting on a bill to make it tougher to investigate &amp; prosecute bank fraud."
2016-02-04 15:58:39;SenWarren;Nope — right now on the House floor, Wall St buddies are pushing a bill to make it tougher to prosecute bank fraud.
2016-02-04 15:58:21;SenWarren;You’d think big banks would be happy with enforcement so tepid that they could just bake fines into the cost of doing business, right?
2016-02-04 15:58:04;SenWarren;Systematic fraud on Wall St helped spark the 2008 financial crisis – but not a single Wall St executive went to jail.
2016-02-03 18:26:40;SenWarren;If anyone in Congress thinks they can make it harder to crack down on corporate criminals, I promise you: The American people are watching.
2016-02-03 18:26:10;SenWarren;"Today I spoke on the Senate floor about our rigged justice system for the rich &amp; powerful. Watch: https://t.co/NWX8Et2hqA"
2016-02-03 18:25:09;SenWarren;"The American people remember who broke our economy &amp; who made out like bandits – and they didn’t send us here to help the bandits."
2016-02-03 18:24:44;SenWarren;"Want to see the rigged game in action? Tomorrow, the House will vote on a GOP bill to make it harder to investigate &amp; prosecute bank fraud."
2016-02-03 18:24:23;SenWarren;It’s not equal justice when a kid gets thrown in jail for stealing a car, while a CEO gets a huge raise when his company steals billions.
2016-02-03 18:24:02;SenWarren;"We have one set of law on the books, but two legal systems: One for the rich &amp; powerful, and one for everyone else."

2016-02-03 00:24:34;SenWarren;Today I urged Congress to reject the #TPP deal before it makes things even worse for America’s families: https://t.co/h339ZKInfy
2016-02-03 00:24:00;SenWarren;Congress will have to vote straight up or down on #TPP.  We won’t have a chance to strip out any of the worst provisions, like ISDS.
2016-02-03 00:23:40;SenWarren;A rigged process produces a rigged outcome. Evidence of this tilt can be seen in a key #TPP provision: ISDS.
2016-02-03 00:23:04;SenWarren;12 countries will sign the #TPP trade deal on Thursday - but it won't go into effect unless Congress approves it.
2016-02-01 22:51:40;SenWarren;Today I asked the Senate GOP: If you won't support #InTheRed, then what's your plan for student loan debt? https://t.co/kIjPpgSgRy

2016-01-29 15:44:21;SenWarren;The next president can honor the simple notion that nobody is above the law, but it will happen only if voters demand it.
2016-01-29 15:43:44;SenWarren;Read my new @nytimes op-ed about how personnel is policy for enforcing federal laws: https://t.co/BZZSpjm7VS
2016-01-29 15:43:15;SenWarren;Today my office released a report on 20 of the worst federal enforcement failures in 2015: https://t.co/u0R2JX1BNd
2016-01-29 15:42:42;SenWarren;Presidents don’t control most day-to-day enforcement decisions, but they do nominate heads of agencies. That makes all the difference.
2016-01-29 15:42:24;SenWarren;Much of the attention on DC focuses on enacting laws, but a law that's not enforced may as well not even be a law at all.
2016-01-29 15:42:10;SenWarren;2016 candidates are pitching their legislative agendas, but voters should consider what presidents can do without Congress.

2016-01-21 20:37:12;SenWarren;"This Congress doesn’t lack workable ideas for how to root out the influence of money in politics; it just lacks the spine to do them."
2016-01-21 20:36:56;SenWarren;Here’s a whole list of things Congress could do if we had the courage to stand up to the super-wealthy few: https://t.co/xjGe3EzdgA
2016-01-21 20:36:19;SenWarren;We can – and we should – blame the Supreme Court for #CitizensUnited. But that is no excuse for doing nothing.
2016-01-21 20:36:00;SenWarren;"Money floods our political system, letting a handful of billionaires shape who gets into Congress &amp; may decide who sits in the White House."
2016-01-21 20:35:41;SenWarren;Six years ago today, #CitizensUnited turned loose a flood of hidden money that is about to drown our democracy.

2016-01-11 22:26:50;SenWarren;Very glad to speak to @ShuttleCDRKelly today about ways we can keep fighting to #StopGunViolence in America. https://t.co/DskXFUE3UB
2016-01-07 23:04:38;SenWarren;This #KeystoneXL lawsuit shows: ISDS was a bad idea for NAFTA, and it’s a bad idea for TPP. https://t.co/JgmCXPEge8

2016-01-05 02:05:27;SenWarren;I strongly support @POTUS’s action to #stopgunviolence. If Congress won’t step up to keep our kids safe, somebody else needs to start.
2016-01-05 02:05:07;SenWarren;Gun violence is an epidemic. But day after day, tragedy after tragedy, the GOP has blocked even the smallest steps to #stopgunviolence.
