2016-02-07 02:53:08;newtgingrich;Cruz very effective in describing the death of his sister to drug addiction. A very sad personal testimony.

2016-02-07 02:48:13;newtgingrich;Kasich first hundred days right planning goal for gop
2016-02-07 02:46:30;newtgingrich;Kasich was brilliant deal maker in balancing the federal budget for four years. I was there and he was brilliant and persistent.
2016-02-07 02:45:13;newtgingrich;Trump hits it out of the park in describing effective deal making
2016-02-07 02:44:29;newtgingrich;Cruz good on repealing Obama executive orders on first day exactly right and should be a universal gop pledge
2016-02-07 02:42:34;newtgingrich;Bush-Rubio assault on Obama plan to close Guantanamo   on target
2016-02-07 02:33:35;newtgingrich;Trump focus on cutting off money to ISIS actually pretty sophisticated
2016-02-07 02:32:56;newtgingrich;Rubio right about poisonous impact of Obama-iran deal in the sunni world where no one trusts america today

2016-02-07 02:09:20;newtgingrich;Jeb bush hits hard at trump on using eminent domain for private profit. Trump ends up attacking audience. Pettiest moments of debate so far

2016-02-07 01:41:15;newtgingrich;My view we should preempt n korean launches because emp ( electromagnetic pulse) threat is catastrophic
2016-02-07 01:40:00;newtgingrich;Biggest event today is north korean missile test . Delighted that martha raddarz raised it. Very smart answer by cruz mentioning emp threat
2016-02-07 01:27:21;newtgingrich;Cruz very good in apologizing directly to carson for iowa mistake suggesting carson would drop out
2016-02-07 01:25:58;newtgingrich;Carson uses self deprecating humor then cites reagans birthday and his 11th commandment to not attack other republicans. Puts cruz on spot
2016-02-07 01:23:50;newtgingrich;Trump retakes control and redefines the question
2016-02-07 01:22:45;newtgingrich;Cruz first answer positive, avoiding conflict with trump. Interesting strategy

2016-01-29 03:01:49;newtgingrich;Rubio very intense in outlining a program to stop illegal immigration. Bush given chance to hit Rubio on immigration and takes it.
2016-01-29 02:55:35;newtgingrich;This is a very substance focused debate.
2016-01-29 02:53:58;newtgingrich;Jeb Bush exactly right on getting Puerto Rico's finances in order with no federal taxpayer bailout.Will need a federal control board.
2016-01-29 02:52:37;newtgingrich;Rand Paul on target in citing criminal justice reform as a key opportunity for a better future
2016-01-29 02:49:47;newtgingrich;Christie smart to cite cutting off tax paid funding for Planned Parenthood.
2016-01-29 02:48:26;newtgingrich;Interesting that Huckabee and Santorum joined Trump at his veterans fundraiser. They were the 2008 and 2012 iowa winners
2016-01-29 02:43:40;newtgingrich;Jeb Bush's focus on overhauling the Veterans Administration is exactly right and his pledge to fire the incompetent is refreshing
2016-01-29 02:39:08;newtgingrich;I love it when dr carson says we need to stop letting political correctness define our policies.
2016-01-29 02:35:25;newtgingrich;Bush effective in saying we have to get lawyers off the backs of the military. A big problem weakening our military and intelligence efforts
2016-01-29 02:33:58;newtgingrich;Rubio very effective defining Radical Islamist with violence talk leading to violent actions .
2016-01-29 02:33:15;newtgingrich;Rubio very effective defining vote on Assad not ISIS showed his knowledge@, reminder of Kerry's promise of unbelievably small attacks worked
2016-01-29 02:31:12;newtgingrich;Cruz is hurting himself with overly pushy approach to trying to redefine the debate and seize time hurts him and makes him smaller
2016-01-29 02:28:46;newtgingrich;Carson's line he had more 2 am life and death phone calls than anyone else in race is profound if you forget politics and just reflect on it
2016-01-29 02:25:16;newtgingrich;Kasich's string of New Hampshire newspaper endorsements is very impressive.substance and optimism are having an impact.
2016-01-29 02:19:38;newtgingrich;Chris Wallace is doing a good job of asking pointed but nit hostile questions
2016-01-29 02:18:19;newtgingrich;With Trump gone Dr Carson is the clear citizen candidate on this stage. His decency and intelligence serve him well.
2016-01-29 02:17:22;newtgingrich;Kasich has remarkable record welfare reform,military reform,balancing federal budget for 4 straight years,creating 400,000 jobs as Governor.
2016-01-29 02:15:23;newtgingrich;Rand Paul is a remarkably articulate explainer of constitutional principles in the tradition of his father
2016-01-29 02:09:44;newtgingrich;Jeb Bush's enthusiasm for his family is authentic and makes him more believable.
2016-01-29 02:08:55;newtgingrich;Marco Rubio's reminder that Hillary Clinton might appoint President Obama to the Supreme Court is going to ve a powerful issue.
2016-01-29 02:07:27;newtgingrich;Ted Cruz had a very clever opening statement with especially amusing summary of Trump's attack technique.He also identified well with Iowans

2016-01-29 01:12:36;newtgingrich;No Trump may give Kasich the chance to grow nationally the way he has been growing in New Hampshire. Will be fascinating to watch.
2016-01-29 01:11:27;newtgingrich;Getting ready to watch the Iowa gop debate. Will be fascinating with or without trump. No trump increases Cruz-Rubio contest.

2016-01-15 04:13:14;newtgingrich;Rubio taking on cruz is pretty effective with clearly prepared list of 11 assaults.audience not sympathetic to cruz counterattack.
2016-01-15 04:04:04;newtgingrich;Very strong Christie answer on crime and Obama' s support for the criminal over the police. It may be Christie's best answer of the night
2016-01-15 03:56:20;newtgingrich;Trump on business issues has a totally different range of knowledge from the other candidates. It is probably his strongest area in policy
2016-01-15 03:54:54;newtgingrich;The exchange on taxes between Cruz and Rubio is factual, serious and policy debate at its best
2016-01-15 03:36:23;newtgingrich;"Kasich defense of Trump on China and Trump's ""i like him tonight"" an interesting exchange. Kasich sustains Trump's core point on China"
2016-01-15 03:34:24;newtgingrich;Trump on China is very compelling. I suspect he is winning this argument.
2016-01-15 03:28:06;newtgingrich;Rubio is much firmer and tougher in this debate
2016-01-15 03:25:53;newtgingrich;Very sound response by Kasich distinguishing Syrian refugees from our allies in the region
2016-01-15 03:24:00;newtgingrich;"Jeb Bush response to Trump on Muslim position strong and coherent.Trump response ""I want security for this country"" may explain poll numbers"
2016-01-15 03:21:21;newtgingrich;"Trump. Answer on rethinking Muslim comments ""no"". He explains why it has to be thought through and not be ""the stupid country"""
2016-01-15 03:17:51;newtgingrich;Ben Carson did very well on fighting ISIS and what Obama is doing wrong
2016-01-15 03:05:59;newtgingrich;Trump's explanation of New York after 9/11 is very powerful and compelling
2016-01-15 02:59:17;newtgingrich;Side note, I like Clay Mathews optimism about the upcoming game with Arizona.
2016-01-15 02:56:39;newtgingrich;Rubio just hit the Second amendment question out of the park. He is methodically taking apart the Obama argument on guns.
2016-01-15 02:47:34;newtgingrich;Ben Carson's answer on Bill and Hillary with tough description of decay of America by secular progressives is his best answer of campaign.
2016-01-15 02:46:10;newtgingrich;Governor Nikki Haley has a great smile and she is right at home in a South Carolina audience.
2016-01-15 02:44:17;newtgingrich;"Kasich response on Sanders ""we will carry every state"" may be right. Sanders could be the new George MCGovern."
2016-01-15 02:43:23;newtgingrich;Carson doing a good job reinforcing the Christie-Bush plea for all the candidates to focus on beating Hillary.
2016-01-15 02:42:09;newtgingrich;Jeb Bush's assertion that everyone on the stage is better than Hillary. He continues his best performance of the campaign so far.
2016-01-15 02:40:54;newtgingrich;Chris Christie doing a good job defending his record.
2016-01-15 02:38:16;newtgingrich;Trump doing a good job of explaining his anger. Millions of angry Americans probably agree with Trump's anger. Explains his poll numbers.
2016-01-15 02:34:43;newtgingrich;This 'birther' exchange illustrates how smart ted cruz is and how irrepressible Trump is.great theater but not relevant to governing.
2016-01-15 02:24:07;newtgingrich;Cruz handled the New York Times hit piece pretty well.
2016-01-15 02:23:39;newtgingrich;Trump is knocking the refugee question out of the park. He identifies American safety as more important than male Syrian refugees.
2016-01-15 02:16:32;newtgingrich;Marco Rubio is the toughest, most aggressive he has been in his first answer. These candidates have brought their A game.
2016-01-15 02:15:25;newtgingrich;Jeb Bush's first answer is most intense, most aggressive, most competent he has been in entire campaign.This is best prepared he has been.
2016-01-15 02:13:26;newtgingrich;Kasich's focus on job creators and the need to give them both incentives and confidence to create jobs is exactly right.
2016-01-15 02:10:40;newtgingrich;"Christie's describing the State of the Union as ""story time with Barack Obama"" is very clever"
2016-01-15 02:07:24;newtgingrich;Ted cruz had a very good opening focusing on our sailors and Iranian.He is also smart to unify the entire team of candidates in his opening.

2016-01-14 21:41:13;newtgingrich;Kerry and Obama have need to appease the Iranians no matter how outrageous and offensive they are.No wonder the Saudis no longer trust them.
2016-01-14 21:39:46;newtgingrich;It is so disgusting to see the State Dept spokesman defend the Iranian abuse of our sailors that it would legitimize defunding his office.

2016-01-13 03:11:53;newtgingrich;"""Unarmed truth"" as Obama advocated in closing is simply killed by the ISIS, N Korean, Boko Harum types of evil. It is A formula for defeat."
2016-01-13 03:08:48;newtgingrich;If this is shorter i am glad he didn't go for a LONG speech
2016-01-13 03:01:38;newtgingrich;Today a Moslem fanatic tried to kill his teacher in France.Local Jews warned not to wear yarmulkes because to avoid attack. Obama,No mention
2016-01-13 02:58:43;newtgingrich;Why is it so hard for the Obama team to acknowledge the war against Christians being waged across the Middle East?
2016-01-13 02:57:29;newtgingrich;As Pres Obama defends Moslems and Mosques he is watched by two Nuns whose religious liberty he threatens.No word about Christian beheadings.
2016-01-13 02:51:52;newtgingrich;Pres Obama cites Iranian deal on day the Iranian dictatorship seized ten American sailors. Iran can't be bad enough to shake Obama or Kerry.
2016-01-13 02:46:11;newtgingrich;Pres Obama totally underestimates threat to American cities from terrorists with nuclear or chemical weapons.Note last weeks N Korean bomb.
2016-01-13 02:44:04;newtgingrich;"""priority number one is protecting the American people,""says Obama. Then why the Syrian refugee decision."
2016-01-13 02:39:19;newtgingrich;Pres Obama: gas under two bucks a gallon ain't bad. When i proposed we could get gas under $2.50 a gallon in 2012 he attacked me personally.
2016-01-13 02:29:06;newtgingrich;Did President Obama just suggest a training requirement for collecting unemployment compensation? That would be real change.
2016-01-13 02:25:51;newtgingrich;93% of Detroit students fail basic tests, 87% of Baltimore students fail math exam.No reform offered by Obama he left these children behind.
2016-01-13 02:21:11;newtgingrich;Obama trying to sell the current economy as good is like describing the Middle East as peaceful. This is a weak economy with too few jobs
2016-01-13 02:17:58;newtgingrich;President Obama described reinventing our energy sector yet he opposed the breakthroughs which brought down the price of oil and gas.
2016-01-13 02:09:14;newtgingrich;This may be the last Democratic State of the Union for a long time.
