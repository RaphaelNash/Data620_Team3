2016-08-03 20:49:14;SenSanders;It is class warfare when the wealthy buy our elections to get tax breaks for themselves and cut spending to programs the rest of us need.
2016-08-03 18:24:24;SenSanders;Lawmakers shouldn’t be trying to suppress the vote. They should be trying to get people to turn out in record numbers every single year.
2016-08-03 15:51:18;SenSanders;It's cruel for Republicans to blame the poor for a deficit the GOP caused by forgetting to pay for two wars and giving the 1% tax breaks.

2016-06-02 13:23:15;SenSanders;If we do not address the planetary crisis of climate change, we will be judged by future generations and by history in a very negative way.
2016-06-02 01:17:09;SenSanders;Understanding the magnitude of the climate crisis also means realizing that good environmental policy is also good economic policy.
2016-06-01 22:57:13;SenSanders;A transaction fee on Wall Street would not only raise billions in new revenue, it would curb harmful speculation.
2016-06-01 20:44:14;SenSanders;In my view, democratic socialism means that a few ultra-wealthy people should not have total control of our politics and economics.
2016-06-01 18:23:10;SenSanders;It's not right that despite an increase in worker productivity for decades, the average worker is working longer hours for lower wages.
2016-06-01 15:56:04;SenSanders;I think there is a lot to be learned from Scandinavia where health care and college education are provided to all, regardless of income.
2016-06-01 13:25:06;SenSanders;If we are serious about combatting climate change, we need to put an end to fracking all over this country.
2016-06-01 01:09:15;SenSanders;What we have got to do is to redefine who we can be as a nation. What rights we are entitled to as humans. That's the struggle.
2016-05-31 22:14:03;SenSanders;Health care is a right, not a privilege. Everyone in America should be able to access the health care they need regardless of their income.
2016-05-31 19:48:10;SenSanders;Here's a radical idea: No full-time worker should live in poverty. We must raise the minimum wage to a living wage of $15 an hour.
2016-05-31 17:27:18;SenSanders;The need for real campaign finance reform is not a progressive issue. It is not a conservative issue. It is an American issue.
2016-05-31 15:32:05;SenSanders;I think the issue of income and wealth inequality is in fact a moral issue. It is an issue that we must confront here and across the world.
2016-05-31 13:04:09;SenSanders;Fewer people voting and and the wealthy contributing huge amounts of money-- this is the kind of “democracy” the ruling class likes.
2016-05-31 01:24:09;SenSanders;When workers don't have to worry about how they are going to pay rent, they become better workers. Raising the minimum wage is common sense.
2016-05-30 23:12:08;SenSanders;No parent should have to send their sick child to school because they can't take a day from work. We need paid family leave in America.
2016-05-30 20:51:17;SenSanders;The fact is there's been class warfare for the last thirty years, but it's been the ruling class taking on the middle class and poor.
2016-05-30 18:06:03;SenSanders;We must go beyond fine speeches if we're serious about protecting the needs of veterans. They've protected us. Now we must protect them.

2016-05-28 17:56:04;SenSanders;Before Social Security was enacted, about half of America's seniors lived in poverty. We must preserve and expand Social Security benefits.

2016-05-28 01:05:13;SenSanders;The class of 2016 has an average debt of $37,172, the highest level of debt yet! In my view, we must make public colleges tuition free.
2016-05-27 22:54:03;SenSanders;Social Security has been the most successful anti-poverty program in American history. That's why we must expand benefits, not cut them.
2016-05-27 20:20:17;SenSanders;It makes no sense to degrade our environment in the interest of quick profits only to later spend billions to remedy the mess we've made.
2016-05-27 17:58:22;SenSanders;If we want a vibrant democracy, where candidates have an even playing field, we need to move toward public funding of elections.

2016-03-17 18:04:10;SenSanders;We give tax breaks to companies that outsource jobs to the tune of $500 billion in a ten-year period. Maybe it’s time to end that absurdity.

2016-03-17 13:20:00;SenSanders;Poverty is not just discomfort, it is often a death sentence. People with income in the bottom 20% die seven years earlier than the top 20%.
2016-03-17 01:19:09;SenSanders;I don't think many lawmakers know that wages have been stagnant for 35 years. They don't see what people are going through.

2016-03-13 20:07:02;SenSanders;It's outrageous that the median female worker earned $1,337 less last year than she did in 2007.

2016-03-12 21:38:05;SenSanders;Nearly 4 million seniors experience food insecurity. We must ensure that the generation that built our great nation does not go hungry.
2016-03-12 19:12:09;SenSanders;Our health care system is broken when millions who have health coverage can't afford to see a doctor due to high copayments and deductibles.
2016-03-12 16:53:00;SenSanders;It is more than irresponsible for my Republican colleagues to risk the future of our planet in order to pander to fossil fuel lobbyists.
2016-03-12 14:22:01;SenSanders;The test of a great nation is not how many wars we can engage in, but how we can use our strength to resolve conflicts in a peaceful way.
2016-03-12 01:47:13;SenSanders;We have such a large national debt because George W. Bush gave tax breaks to billionaires and took us into two wars he forgot to pay for.
