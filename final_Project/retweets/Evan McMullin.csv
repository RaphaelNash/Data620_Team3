2017-01-30 17:35:46;Evan_McMullin;If Trump disregards the courts and Congress fails to check him when necessary, the only thing left will be old fashioned civil disobedience.
2017-01-30 17:33:01;Evan_McMullin;This is our best hope of checking Trump, though it is not at all surefire. In fact, in the end, it may not be enough.
2017-01-30 17:31:36;Evan_McMullin;However, efforts must also be far more focused. People must engage directly with their and other representatives and staff in Congress.
2017-01-30 17:29:57;Evan_McMullin;The ongoing protests are powerful. They set a macro tone that many members of Congress cannot ignore.
2017-01-30 17:28:26;Evan_McMullin;This means calling your Congressmen's offices daily, showing up and asking for meetings, writing op-eds, donating in support or opposition.
2017-01-30 17:22:17;Evan_McMullin;I believe our best next step is to make it a political imperative for members of Congress, especially Republicans, to stand up to Trump.
2017-01-30 17:20:50;Evan_McMullin;As an authoritarian, he will attempt to run roughshod over all checks on his power: laws, branches of government, cultural norms, the press.

2017-01-30 17:16:18;Evan_McMullin;In the case of this immigration executive order, Trump also disregarded the input of Executive Branch departments, agencies, and experts.
2017-01-30 17:14:42;Evan_McMullin;I also warned that, due to Trump's lack of respect for the courts, he was likely to ignore them if they objected to his activities.

2017-01-28 02:16:26;Evan_McMullin;13. Knowing that there is nothing without liberty, others of us will cast fear aside and unite its defense. We are @StandUpRepublic.
2017-01-28 02:16:06;Evan_McMullin;12. It is they who most bear responsibility for liberty's loss, and to whom self-reflection will be most unkind as freedom's flame dims.
2017-01-28 02:15:48;Evan_McMullin;11. Others will decide they'd just rather not weather the public criticism, loss of social standing, and temporal consequences required.
2017-01-28 02:15:28;Evan_McMullin;10. Doing so isn't easy. In fact, many will stare into the eyes of authoritarianism and decide they lack the courage to resist it.
2017-01-28 02:15:08;Evan_McMullin;9. We are they who bear the responsibility of opposing authoritarianism in the defense of liberty with of all of our might.
2017-01-28 02:14:50;Evan_McMullin;8. But others do see and understand exactly what's happening. We understand the sheer peril of untruth and the loss of checks on power.
2017-01-28 02:14:27;Evan_McMullin;7. Many conservatives and other Americans won't see or understand this scheme as our liberties slip away gradually and without fanfare.
2017-01-28 02:14:07;Evan_McMullin;6. Trump and Steve Bannon are now feeding political catnip to conservatives for this very reason. And it's working.
2017-01-28 02:13:49;Evan_McMullin;5. Authoritarians always placate their partisan disciples with coveted policies so they'll turn a blind eye to liberty's erosion.
2017-01-28 02:13:32;Evan_McMullin;4. Without liberty, no right, no policy, no life, no dignity, no word, no truth, no future is secure.
2017-01-28 02:13:11;Evan_McMullin;3. But there is no issue more important for conservatives, and ALL Americans, than liberty and the defense of our constitutional republic.
2017-01-28 02:12:45;Evan_McMullin;2. After eight years of a Democrat-controlled White House, most conservatives are understandably eager for changes on a number of issues.

2016-11-18 19:24:02;Evan_McMullin;As the Trump Administration takes shape, we must not allow the normalization of racial and religious bigotry in America.
