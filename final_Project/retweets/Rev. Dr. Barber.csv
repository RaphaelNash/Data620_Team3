2016-12-30 21:00:13;RevDrBarber;We know from history and from experience in #MoralMondays that prophetic faith is sorely needed to repair the heart of our democracy.
2016-12-30 20:59:43;RevDrBarber;This prophetic tradition of moral dissent has deep foundations upon which we stand today.
2016-12-30 20:58:55;RevDrBarber;And the same moral center claimed by the abolitionists, those who stood against Jim Crow, and those who stood against apartheid.
2016-12-30 20:58:28;RevDrBarber;This is the same moral center claimed by the prophets, Jesus, and the Social Gospelers.
2016-12-30 20:57:56;RevDrBarber;We must move beyond left or right politics, in order to embrace the moral center of this nation.
2016-12-30 20:57:09;RevDrBarber;Standing down is not an option. We'll use every nonviolent tool we have at our disposal to advance a #MoralAgenda. https://t.co/0RroaCpymQ
2016-12-30 20:56:38;RevDrBarber;From t/state house to t/Congress all elected leaders should know we're committed to standing for our deepest moral values in t/public square
2016-12-30 20:56:08;RevDrBarber;We as religious leaders are compelled to counsel @realdonaldtrump whether he listens and changes or not. https://t.co/0RroaCpymQ
2016-12-30 20:55:36;RevDrBarber;.@realdonaldtrump needs to hear that declaring “I” and “I alone can fix things” is contrary to the religious value of humility.
2016-12-30 20:55:08;RevDrBarber;We serve the vulnerable not only by personal charity but also public policy.
2016-12-30 20:54:27;RevDrBarber;God defines greatness by who you serve, by how you help the poor, the sick, the immigrant, the broken, and the least of these.

2016-12-30 20:52:27;RevDrBarber;They have been terribly silent on issues of systemic racism, classism, and militarism in their modern-day manifestations.
2016-12-30 20:51:59;RevDrBarber;There are hundreds of scriptures that call us to work for the poor, the sick, the immigrant, and the least of these. https://t.co/0RroaCpymQ
2016-12-30 20:51:39;RevDrBarber;They were terribly silent on the more than 2,000 scriptures that call us to public policies which stand for justice.
2016-12-30 20:51:11;RevDrBarber;The so-called white evangelicals surrounding Trump say so much about what God says so little and so little about what God says so much.
2016-12-30 20:50:49;RevDrBarber;This form of evangelicalism endorsed and attached itself to the @realdonaldtrump campaign and it must be challenged.
2016-12-30 20:50:06;RevDrBarber;This limited framework is so far from biblical faith and the politics of God that it's heretical.
2016-12-30 20:49:44;RevDrBarber;This evangelicalism wrongly purports that supporting prayer in school and property rights are the major moral issues of our time.
2016-12-30 20:49:14;RevDrBarber;This evangelicalism wrongly purports that the major moral issues of our time are standing against LGBTQ people and women’s health.
2016-12-30 20:48:39;RevDrBarber;"The theological malpractice of t/so-called white evangelicals &amp; others who've placed themselves as Trump's moral support demands a response."

2016-12-29 21:01:14;RevDrBarber;These clergy may now possibly have to bury persons who die from lack of access to emergency room and hospital care.
2016-12-29 21:00:33;RevDrBarber;And blame should be laid at every clergy persons feet charged to stand with and for the poor who were sadly silent.
2016-12-29 20:50:58;RevDrBarber;Blame should be laid at the feet of the board members at @Vidant_Health who accepted distorted truths about profits over people's dignity.
2016-12-29 20:50:17;RevDrBarber;Blame should be laid at the desk of congressional leaders who did not stand up against the demolition of a hospital in their state.
2016-12-29 20:49:51;RevDrBarber;This includes @PatMcCroryNC all the way down to state legislators, especially elected leaders from the area who refused to fight to save it.
2016-12-29 20:39:46;RevDrBarber;Blame should be laid at the feet of every state leader who denied Medicaid expansion and refused to fight to save this hospital.
2016-12-29 20:39:27;RevDrBarber;.@MayorONeal, citizens of Belhaven, our lawyers, and the @NCNAACP fought a righteous fight.
2016-12-29 20:38:16;RevDrBarber;We have lost our way when health care is destroyed and not saved.

2016-12-02 20:52:16;RevDrBarber;Third, you still have not addressed policy and systemic issues.
2016-12-02 20:51:44;RevDrBarber;Why? Because first of all you gloss over the action. Second, you give @realDonaldTrump a white privilege pass you'd never give @BarackObama
2016-12-02 20:51:06;RevDrBarber;How do you move pass racism without repentance and without changing policies? This kind of trivialization is also racism.
2016-12-02 20:50:41;RevDrBarber;For instance, when @SpeakerRyan said last evening that though he said @realDonaldTrump was a racist, now they have moved passed it.
2016-12-02 20:50:05;RevDrBarber;If you discount racial disparities and say we simply address inequality by being “Americans” you are camouflaging white supremacy.
2016-12-02 20:49:27;RevDrBarber;If you refuse to raise wages that hurts black people and you are not disavowing white supremacy.
2016-12-02 20:48:37;RevDrBarber;If you avow cuts to health care that will have disparate impact on black people you are not disavowing white supremacy.
2016-12-02 20:48:04;RevDrBarber;If you disavow white supremacist but still avow over suppression you’re not disavowing white supremacy.
2016-12-02 20:47:47;RevDrBarber;And that if @realDonaldTrump disavowed he would be Ok on race.

2016-11-21 19:46:24;RevDrBarber;Progressives must recognize that only addressing the so-called economic issues without a deep dive into race issues is a form of racism.
2016-11-21 19:45:35;RevDrBarber;You cannot address America’s economic issues without addressing racism and you cannot address racism without addressing economics.
2016-11-21 19:45:01;RevDrBarber;We can’t attempt to address America's problems and psychic wound without a grownup conversation and redemptive focus on race and class.
2016-11-21 19:44:23;RevDrBarber;They say democrats need a better economic message but this is a dangerous analysis.
2016-11-21 19:43:41;RevDrBarber;We can’t blame the election on the rage of the white working class without dealing with the reactionary power of racism.
2016-11-21 19:43:18;RevDrBarber;I’m worried about progressives and Democrats who want to blame @realdonaldtrump election on rage of white working class.

2016-11-11 16:11:31;RevDrBarber;Everyone of us who believe in justice must live it even more now.
2016-11-11 16:11:05;RevDrBarber;As the political process ends the prophetic task must continue and abound even the more.
2016-11-11 16:10:46;RevDrBarber;Through this period we will have to be faithful and even more committed to what we believe despite what many in the country have done.
2016-11-11 16:10:10;RevDrBarber;And now we will have to suffer the consequences of this election because of the rejection of our higher values.
2016-11-11 16:09:29;RevDrBarber;Many in the country have rejected justice, love, grace, equality, and the common good. This has been exposed for all to see.
2016-11-11 16:09:01;RevDrBarber;This election was ultimately not about Trump and Clinton but something much deeper.
2016-11-11 16:08:22;RevDrBarber;"This “rejection"" election doesn’t change our calling. We are seeing what we would rather not see but in the economy of God must see."
2016-11-11 16:06:38;RevDrBarber;Like Saul we must keep being the prophetic voice and vision God has called us to be.
2016-11-11 16:06:17;RevDrBarber;"“Listen to all that the people are saying to you; it is not you they have rejected, but they have rejected me as their king.”"
2016-11-11 16:05:58;RevDrBarber;Tonight and in the days to come we must understand what God told the prophet Samuel. 1 Samuel 8:7
2016-11-11 16:03:43;RevDrBarber;This is where we redouble our commitment to be instruments of truth, love, and justice.
2016-11-11 16:03:11;RevDrBarber;As ugly as it is we must see the sickness of our country openly and clearly.
2016-11-11 16:02:33;RevDrBarber;This is where we must be honest about the depth of racism and the psychic sickness of our country.
2016-11-11 16:02:13;RevDrBarber;This is a moment where we must remember how our ancestors responded to disappointment without detouring from their march toward justice.
2016-11-11 16:00:42;RevDrBarber;This is a moment were faith must be real.

2016-05-24 00:58:32;RevDrBarber;when politicians pollute water not just in Flint but in rural areas then cut a deal to shelter the polluters, then we have a heart problem
