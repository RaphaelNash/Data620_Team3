2017-01-29 23:52:13;WesleyLowery;@Gregors3 @dadofboys5 @JohnHime Chicago, for example, has relatively few fatal shootings by police officers. As do Baltimore and DC
2017-01-29 23:51:27;WesleyLowery;@Gregors3 @dadofboys5 @JohnHime no, actually, we've run that analysis. Police shootings don't occur more often in places with high crime
2017-01-29 23:48:16;WesleyLowery;@r_mosley @bradspink I, like all Americans, have been conditioned via media to assume black men to be inherently more violent, for example
2017-01-29 23:41:35;WesleyLowery;@bradspink @r_mosley yes. I think all humans carry racial bias because we all live in a society that reinforces it

2017-01-29 22:55:15;WesleyLowery;@dadofboys5 @JohnHime we found a racial disparity that can not be explained by violent crime
2017-01-29 22:50:31;WesleyLowery;@JohnHime @dadofboys5 race is one of many factors - all of which we've explored during our 3 year study

2016-11-30 17:24:13;WesleyLowery;@tlombardo21 i'd suggest reading the rest of the tweets in the series

2016-11-30 17:17:24;WesleyLowery;@chrisbraly they didn't know his criminal record, so irrelevant to outcome of the interaction (but, you already knew that)
2016-11-30 17:12:00;WesleyLowery;@Mj8422mc unfortunate you're incapable of having productive, reasonable conversation. feel free to take your juvenile lashing out elsewhere
2016-11-30 17:10:30;WesleyLowery;"@OneTonTurtle @misspell there is no ""lying"" here - that was an action witnessed by another officer and not a factor in decision to fire"
2016-11-30 17:09:59;WesleyLowery;@OneTonTurtle @misspell pulling gun from holster (per officer's account) happens in car and irrelevant to later moment when shots fired
2016-11-30 17:08:50;WesleyLowery;@derekahunter it's almost as if you didn't actually read the string of tweets that you're replying to
2016-11-30 17:07:59;WesleyLowery;@RecDawg34 sure. complying is a factor. but raises question of what is reasonable amount of time to comply. in this case, 7 seconds
2016-11-30 17:07:14;WesleyLowery;"@CanuckCon ""appearing to be a threat"" is quite a subjective distinction when it includes no actual threatening action"
2016-11-30 17:05:56;WesleyLowery;@Mj8422mc that's not what happened at the Bundy ranch
2016-11-30 17:05:19;WesleyLowery;@RecDawg34 haven't seen suggestions he was legally carrying, rather notations that in open carry state perhaps gun in hand =/= justification
2016-11-30 17:01:17;WesleyLowery;@RecDawg34 his criminal record was unknown to the officers, and therefore irrelevant to legal justification of the shooting
2016-11-30 17:00:44;WesleyLowery;@dstarvish he was shot 7 seconds after getting out of the car
2016-11-30 16:59:49;WesleyLowery;@derekahunter many in the public don't think simply having a gun in your hand is enough to justify a shooting, it's my job to note that
2016-11-30 16:58:54;WesleyLowery;@StephHolloway lol pretty sure i understand how this facet of the law works, but thanks for your feedback
2016-11-30 16:58:23;WesleyLowery;"one side: Scott told 10X to drop gun 
other side: yelling frantically =/= 10 distinct commands, Scott had just seconds to comply before shot"
2016-11-30 16:49:52;WesleyLowery;a rorschach test: how patient should officers be w/someone armed with gun (in open carry state) who does not immediately comply/put it down?
2016-11-30 16:47:01;WesleyLowery;@thesampond @kjaynne the officer was black - which you only know because the media has reported that tons of times
2016-11-30 16:39:09;WesleyLowery;@Terrence_Kimi @rolandsmartin that's irrelevant to justification since the officer who fired was not aware of Scott's criminal record
2016-11-30 16:36:07;WesleyLowery;interesting here, DA says Keith Lamont Scott did not raise the gun - meaning a threatening look and gun in hand enough to justify shooting
