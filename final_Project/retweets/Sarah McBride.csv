2016-11-22 20:32:10;SarahEMcBride;13. No data actually backs them up. People's lives are actually on the line. And it puts you on the wrong side of history.
2016-11-22 20:31:15;SarahEMcBride;12. Enough with these crappy takes. They are nothing more than a handful of “liberals” projecting their own discomfort onto voters.
2016-11-22 20:29:50;SarahEMcBride;11. ...a Republican governor looks to have lost re-election, in large part, because of the “bathroom controversy.”
2016-11-22 20:29:30;SarahEMcBride;10. The “hot take” rests on the impression that trans rights is bad politics.  In NC, a state that went for Trump...
2016-11-22 20:29:06;SarahEMcBride;9. But the absurdity of their hot take doesn’t end there.  Take North Carolina!
2016-11-22 20:28:52;SarahEMcBride;8. So let’s be clear, when these people say trans ppl were featured too much in this election, they mean at all.
2016-11-22 20:28:36;SarahEMcBride;7. That means trans voices made up .2% of the entire Dem convention.
2016-11-22 20:28:07;SarahEMcBride;6. Indeed she did lift up several trans voices – mine included – but to give you some context, I spoke for 3 mins at the convention.
2016-11-22 20:27:32;SarahEMcBride;6. Show me a single time where Hillary explicitly talked about trans ppl and restrooms.  I don’t think it exists.
2016-11-22 20:27:16;SarahEMcBride;5. ...but that’s because every previous candidate dedicated approximately zero minutes to the issue while campaigning.
2016-11-22 20:26:45;SarahEMcBride;4. Yes, Hillary talked more about trans rights this election than any previous candidate...
2016-11-22 20:26:23;SarahEMcBride;3. The entire “bathroom controversy” was an invention by GOPers.  55 anti-trans bill were intro'd this year to gin up the conservative base.
2016-11-22 20:25:51;SarahEMcBride;2. For a moment, we’ll set aside the fact that trans ppl are workers and if they can’t access restrooms, it becomes difficult to hold a job.
2016-11-22 20:25:00;SarahEMcBride;"1. Alright, I’ve now seen a few “hot takes” about how Hillary cared too much about ""bathrooms"" and not enough about workers."
2016-11-22 15:13:08;SarahEMcBride;RT @chasestrangio: Demanding to be able to exist in public space is not identity politics it is survival politics.
2016-11-22 03:05:24;SarahEMcBride;@TrueflintThomas I certainly believe that can happen (and that those things overlap). Others think they are mutually exclusive.

2016-11-22 02:46:34;SarahEMcBride;With each new Trump scandal, I keep thinking it will be the fact that turns voters against him and then I remember the election is over.

2016-09-26 16:01:32;SarahEMcBride;RT @djshiva: Read this thread. Trump cannot win. Please don't let Trump win. https://t.co/shZFPkYDuJ
2016-09-26 16:00:06;SarahEMcBride;(22) @HillaryClinton is with us and will deliver the change so many of us still so desperately need.
2016-09-26 15:59:42;SarahEMcBride;(21) So let’s get past the “Trump deserve praise for saying the letters #LGBTQ in a speech” baloney.  He opposes everything we need.
2016-09-26 15:59:28;SarahEMcBride;(20) Her ability to grow and evolve, to keep an open mind and an open heart are qualities worthy of praise.
2016-09-26 15:59:03;SarahEMcBride;(19) Yes she evolved on marriage, but so did President Obama, Vice President Biden, Senator Sanders, and so much of the country.
2016-09-26 15:58:46;SarahEMcBride;(18) She’s been with us for decades. Supporting nondiscrim in the 90s and 2000s and becoming the first FLOTUS to march in a pride parade.
2016-09-26 15:58:33;SarahEMcBride;(17) On literally every LGBTQ-related issue today, @HillaryClinton is on the right side of history.
2016-09-26 15:58:13;SarahEMcBride;(16) She’s spoken out about violence against trans women of color and will work to end the HIV and AIDS epidemic once and for all.
2016-09-26 15:57:58;SarahEMcBride;(15) She opposes conversion therapy, will continue the Obama Admins efforts to protect LGBTQ ppl from discrim under existing laws
2016-09-26 15:57:25;SarahEMcBride;(14) As a candidate, LGBTQ equality has been featured and prioritized. She fully supports the Equality Act.
2016-09-26 15:56:59;SarahEMcBride;(13) This was a monumental change, which expanded access to accurate identity docs to significant swaths of the trans population.
2016-09-26 15:56:39;SarahEMcBride;(12) At State, she became one of the first federal officials to deliver for trans folks, when she updated US passport policies.
2016-09-26 15:56:16;SarahEMcBride;(11) @HillaryClinton, on the other hand, made LGBTQ rights a core component of US foreign policy.
2016-09-26 15:56:01;SarahEMcBride;(10) If Trump is the prince of prejudice, Mike Pence is the baron of bigotry. They’re both signing the same tune: discrimination.
2016-09-26 15:55:41;SarahEMcBride;(9) Still unconvinced? In his first governing decision, he nominated as VP a man whose entire national profile rests on being anti-LGBTQ.
2016-09-26 15:54:50;SarahEMcBride;(8) He’s remained totally and conspicuously silent on the biggest legislative priority for the movement, the Equality Act.
2016-09-26 15:54:36;SarahEMcBride;(7) meaning his admin would legalize state-sanctioned bullying of trans kids.
2016-09-26 15:54:21;SarahEMcBride;(6) In fact, Trump opposes lifesaving protections by federal government for trans students…
2016-09-26 15:53:57;SarahEMcBride;(5) Trans rights? Nonstarter for Trump, who refused to describe our rights as human rights and supports ability of states to discriminate.
2016-09-26 15:53:27;SarahEMcBride;(4) A Trump Admin (shiver) would rescind many of @POTUS’ EOs, which could risk workplace protections for millions of #LGBTQ workers.
2016-09-26 15:53:09;SarahEMcBride;(3) He supports legislation that would legalize discrimination against #LGBTQ people, including Kim-Davis style discrimination.
2016-09-26 15:52:44;SarahEMcBride;(2) Trump opposes marriage equality and has promised to appoint judges and justices in the mold of Antonin Scalia.
2016-09-26 15:52:26;SarahEMcBride;(1) First debate is tonight and regardless of whether #LGBTQ issues come up, let’s compare the two candidates on equality, shall we?
