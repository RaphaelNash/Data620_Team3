2016-04-16 18:36:23;kylerush;@Cheston I was wondering how that would work.
2016-04-16 02:29:47;kylerush;Sanders pays a 13.5% tax rate and wants to raise everyone's taxes more than any candidate by far. Why doesn't he pay his fair share?
2016-04-15 02:59:32;kylerush;RT @Nate_Cohn: Clinton's popular vote margins in Ohio and Florida alone was enough to swamp all of Sanders' wins combined
2016-04-15 00:07:44;kylerush;@joelbousley @tcooper9999 they're still not here. Sanders' side is still very thin.
2016-04-15 00:02:42;kylerush;@KirstinElaine1 you're welcome!
2016-04-14 23:48:45;kylerush;@RudeFulk Good. He's gonna need it.
2016-04-14 23:47:02;kylerush;@joelbousley I would've asked the same question :)
2016-04-14 23:46:19;kylerush;@StoddartAJ it was a fair question. Kind of weird to see a castle :)
2016-04-14 23:43:49;kylerush;@joelbousley no I didn't. That's literally the Bernie crowd.
